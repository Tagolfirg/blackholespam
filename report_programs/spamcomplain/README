spamcomplain is a email complaint generator, initially designed to
work with the blackhole spam detection program.  How to use it is
described in the man page.

To install, look at the defines at top of spamcomplain.c and the
PREFIX setting in the Makefile.  I recommend that you install or have
the gnu whois client, jwhois, and have installed the DSBL test
programs found at http://dsbl.org.  If you don't have the latter, make
sure to undefine DO_DSBL.
