--ripMIME 1.2.x----------TO DO LIST---------------

This list is for anyone who wishes to help out with the ripMIME
development, and is wondering what there needs to be done.

I'm always looking out for mailpacks which fail to extract
correctly with ripMIME.  Send them along to pldaniels@pldaniels.com
gzip'd or bzip2'd.  I only have a MODEM/56K connection, so,
dont send anything > 500K (please).

	- Improve the ISO encoded filename decoding routines... add them!
	- Rectify quote encoding handling of CRLF / linebreak sequences as per RFC
		and Kshitij Gupta's email.
